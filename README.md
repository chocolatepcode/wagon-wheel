# Wagon Wheel Demo

Interactive demonstration of the stroboscopic (wagon-wheel) effect that makes helicopter blades appear frozen or moving backwards in videos.

## How to run
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser (no server needed).
3. Use the sliders:
   - __Real Blade Speed (RPM)__ – actual rotation speed
   - __Camera Frame Rate (FPS)__ – how many frames per second the "camera" captures
4. Press __Start Animation__

When the blade completes an integer number of rotations between frames, they appear perfectly still. Slight mismatches produce slow forward or backward motion.

Enjoy the illusion!
